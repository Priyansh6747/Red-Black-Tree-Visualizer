# Red-Black Tree Visualizer

A **Red-Black Tree Visualizer** built with **C++** and **SFML**, designed to help users understand the structure and operations of Red-Black Trees through interactive visualization.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: See the tree structure update dynamically as you perform insertions and deletions.
- **Dynamic Balancing**: Observe rotations and color changes that maintain the Red-Black Tree properties.
- **Error Handling**: Detect and handle edge cases like duplicate insertions or empty deletions gracefully.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for ease of use with a clean, intuitive UI.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash  
   https://github.com/Priyansh6747/Red-Black-Tree-Visualizer
   ```

## Usage

1. The program does not contain a prebuilt executable file, so you need to build it first (or use a released version in the future).
   To build it, open a terminal in the project directory and run:
   ```bash
    mingw32-make -f MakeFile
    ```
2. To run the program, use the following command:
    ```bash
    .\main.exe    
    ```

   > **Note:** No released version is available yet.

## How-it-works

1. Red-Black Tree Properties

    The visualizer enforces the following Red-Black Tree rules:

   1. Each node is either Red or Black.
   2. The root is always Black.
   3. Red nodes cannot have Red children ("No double reds").
   4. Every path from a node to its descendant null nodes
      must have the same number of Black nodes (Black height).

2. Operations
   1. Insertion:
   
      1. Adds a new node and dynamically updates the visualization. 
      2. Recolors and rotates nodes as necessary to maintain Red-Black Tree properties.
   2. Deletion: 
      1. Removes a node and rebalances the tree to restore its properties.
   3. Reset: 
      1. Clears the current tree, allowing you to start fresh.
